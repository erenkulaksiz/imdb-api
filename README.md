#IMDB API project by Eren KulaksÄ±z

##Made with Next.js, along with Axios & MUI.

#How it works?

##The imdb website serves an API. With axios, we can use that API to request film/movie data from database. This is coming handy, which we can use the API for showing the data we got with SCSS. Check the screenshots for more information.

##Starting the project
###use: npm start dev
